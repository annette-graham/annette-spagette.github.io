        <h2>What did you learn for your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h2>
        <p>
          I attempted a 3 minute mindfulness conversation over the phone with my partner in England. It was difficult to take it seriously at first but we gave it our best shot. It wasn't the easiest to do over the phone. I think I listened quite well and I think Simon at least pretended to. We tried the loop technique but we both felt it was a bit unnatural to reiterate what had just been said.
        </p>
        <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
        <p>
          I think I will use the "take one breath a day" technique. It isn't a massive commitment and it is something you can easily build on. Create the intention, and focus on that one breath. Can't be too difficult eh?
