        <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesigmn and rebuild?</h2>
        <p>
          I tried my best to stick to it, but I still found myself getting carried away with the aesthetics of my website from time to time. I realised that I was spending too much time worrying about what images to have on my index page, so focused on the 'process over product' concept and left them as simple placeholders.
        </p>
        <h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h2>
        <p>
          I really liked the idea of meditation. I've tried to meditate a few times myself, but always find it difficult to not get distracted.
        </p>
        <h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation</h2>
        <p>
          I learnt that it's okay to get distracted! You just have to acknowledge the distraction, and draw your attention back to your breathing. The more you manage to focus your attention (even for a few seconds) the easier it will get in the future.
        </p>
        <h2>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
        <p>
          If you have to react (for example, if you have an itch that needs scratching), then you should take five breaths before reacting. This is to "pracice creating space between stimulus and reaction." When you go to physically react, maintain mindfulness by bringing attention to the stimulus, create the intention of reacting, and finally the phyical reaction.
