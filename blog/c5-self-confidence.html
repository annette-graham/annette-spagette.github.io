        <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h2>
        <p>
          Self-awareness and mindfulness are similar in that they both involve looking at, and understanding yourself without judgement. The clarity that mindfullness gives can maybe make it easier to observe yourself clearly.
        </p>
        <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter. What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
        <p>
          I tried the body scan. It took a while to do the inital two minutes of focusing on the breathing. It took me closer to ten haha. I kept getting distracted and starting again. Once I got into it though, it was quite enjoyable. It wasn't easy to focus on some body parts, such as ears and top of my head. I felt quite relaxed and comfortable, and enjoying reflecting on a positive memory. I didn't notice any change in my body after thinking about it though.
        </p>
        <h2>What did you take away fromt he "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>
        <p>
          That emotions are fleeting. They come and go. Emotions do not define us. If we experience sadness, we are not sad. We just feel sad at that point in time and it will pass.
