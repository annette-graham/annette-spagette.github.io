      <h2> Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        <p>I tried Pomodoro and some of The Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive</p>
      <h2> What did you find interesting?</h2>
        <p>Lots of methods involved breaking large tasks into smaller ones, and rewarding yourself with short breaks. In the Seven Ways, they highlight that you don't need to be super productive all of the time. A quote from the Seven Ways that I found interesting and perhaps true: "people don’t procrastinate because they’re lazy. People procrastinate as a self-defense mechanism against doing stuff they despise or doing things too mechanically."</p>
      <h2> What worked for you?</h2>
        <p>I found breaking things into smaller sections and taking more regular breaks worked. After I achieved a certain amount of work, I would turn up my music and have a dance to a couple of songs before getting back to it! Also, going back to the Seven Ways methods, I found that telling someone I would have XYZ completed by a certain time and then showing them my achievement helped me to stay focused. </p>
      <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        <p> Fogg's technique of changing behaviours through having a trigger to prompt a habit, and then celebration after. <p>
