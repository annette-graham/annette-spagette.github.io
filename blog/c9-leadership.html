        <h2>What is your experience of compassionate leadership?</h2>
        <p>
          When I was at university, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had an exam and couple of assignments due in the days following, which I found very difficult to prioritize. The faculty heads showed a massive amount of compassion, giving me extensions on the assignments and increasing my grade for the exam, which I still sat on the original date.
        </p>
        <h2>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h2>
        <p>
          I rather enjoyed this one actually. It felt liberating to think of everyone as good people, especially the few who I don't usually think of in that light.
        </p>
        <h2>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Status</u>:<br/>I think I've achieved some form of status through phase 0. If I look back to sprint 1 and where I was in terms of understanding anything, I have definitely gained a whole lot of knowledge since. This knowledge will only become greater in bootcamp. I hope.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Certainty</u>:<br/>I would say my certainty fluctuated throughout phase 0. One moment I would be certain I was capable of getting through this EDA experience, then I would hit a roadblock and all of a sudden I wasn't so sure anymore. One thing I am certain about is that every day I am learning more, and gaining a deeper understanding of what this whole code business is.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Autonomy</u>:</br>For me, I find there to be a lot I can control in phase 0, and we are given a lot of resources on how to cope with pressure. I have a lot of time before I start bootcamp so I can do the work at whatever pace I feel comfortable with. Maybe this autonomy will diminish once I start bootcamp.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Relatedness</u>:<br/> Everyone I have encountered so far in this experience has been nothing short of fantastic. Everyone is so willing to help each other and share ideas/resources. Whatever apprehension I may of had to begin with was most definitely short lived.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Fairness</u>:</br> Fairness hasn't been relevant during phase 0. Everyone has been nothing but respectful and selfless. I have no doubt this will continue through bootcamp.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, I'm okay with having difficult conversations. Not because I find them enjoyable or anything weird. More because if I have something serious that is bothering me I find it really hard to ignore. I prefer to confront the issue and resolve it asap. Certainly in some cirumstances I agree with the book - sometimes it is better to not raise the issue at all.
