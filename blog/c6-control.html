        <h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h2>
        <p>
          An obvious trigger is getting blocked. I get frustrated when I am presented with a problem and can't figure out which steps I should take to create the desired outcome.
          <br/><br/>I wouldn't say my emotional responses are disproportionate, however. I try to keep a level head and since I have quite a while before bootcamp, I know that I have plenty of time to revise anything that I am unsure of.

        <h2>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise?</h2>
        <p>I think it could be a good method to help calm myself in situations of frustration or anger. Instead of trying to ignore the negative emotions and wait for them to pass, you confront them and breathe your way into calmness. Probably passes much quicker than the former.</p>
