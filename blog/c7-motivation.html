        <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion, and purpose' lens?</h2>
        <p>
          I think life looks sparkly through that lens. I think true happiness comes from a combination of all three. If you can take pleasure from life, are passionate about things, and are motivated to achieve a purpose greater than yourself then you're doing pretty well! Unfortunately I don't think it's as easy as that. For me at least. I have a few more lenses I try on from time to time.
        </p>
        <h2>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values? What do you stand for?</h2>
        <p> My core values:
        <ul>
          <li>Integrity</li>
          <li>Respect for myself and others</li>
          <li>Self-improvement</li>
          <li>Honesty</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        What I stand for:
        <ul>
          <li>Equality</li>
          <li>Acceptance</li>
          <li>Peace</li>
          <li>Fairness</li>
          <li>Caring for others</li>
          <li>Caring for the environment</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't know that resilience could be 'trained', per se. I thought that it was something we might subconsciously learn through life exeperience. So I found it interesting that we could consciously work on our resilience through accessing our inner calm, emotions, and cognition.
        <br/><br/>
        The meditation exercise wasn't particuarly pleasant when I focused on my failures. From time to time, these failures crop into my mind naturally. I feel the same emotional and physiological effects in both situations. Embarassment is the main emotion, and I begin to feel hot and uncomfortable. Focussing on success was a bit nicer though. I might try it again one day. We shall see!
