        <h2>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript provides a functional aspect to websites. Referring back to the house analogy, where HTML was the structure and CSS was the decorations, JavaScript can be seen as the technology in it. Say, for example sensor lights, or blinds that shut automatically when it gets dark.
        </p>
        <h2>What is control flow and loops? Explain using an example process from everyday life.</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow is the order in which the code is executed based on varying circumstances. Compare it to waking up in the morning. We set an alarm during the week, get up, shower, dress, and go to work. Come the weekend we don't set an alarm and enjoy a sleep in.
          <br/>
          Loops involve repetition of instructions until the desired outcome is reached. Real life loops are used in cooking, for example. You add seasoning to your dinner until it's to your taste. You start by adding a little bit, then you taste it, and repeat until it reaches your liking.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are ordered lists starting at 0. Accessing data from an array is as easy as calling the item's place on the list.
          <br/>
          Objects are unordered, and are structured in key-value pairs. You call a specific key's name in order to retrieve its value.
        </p>
        <h2>What are functions are and why they are useful?</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are reusable blocks of code that include several operations for a specific purpose. Functions stop us from having to re-write the same code over and over. Instead, we can just call the function's name!
