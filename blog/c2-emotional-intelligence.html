    <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
    <p>
      First and foremost, I have learned that emotional intelligence is learned. While it may come more naturally to some, we can train ourselves to be more emotionally intelligent. The neuroplasticity of the brain allows us to become more self-aware, more empathetic, more motivated, and better at self-regulating. This can be done through practising mindfulness, even for just a couple of minutes a day.
    </p>
    <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
    <p>
      I think two minutes of mindfulness is a good idea. People can easily spare two minutes a day without being distracted, and it's not an overwhelming amount of time to dedicate to something you might not ordinarily do.
