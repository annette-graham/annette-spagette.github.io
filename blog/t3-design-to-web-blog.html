        <h2>What is a responsive site? Why is responsiveness important?</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive sites are designed to adapt to the many differing screen sizes used to access the internet today. It is important that information on a website is as easy to access on a mobile or tablet as it is on a desktop.
        </p>
        <h2>What is mobile-first design? Why is it important</h2>
        <p>
          As websites are being accessed through many differing screen sizes, designers often build their websites to fit a mobile screen first. This is because it would be more difficult to adapt a webiste designed for a large screen to fit a small one than vice-versa.
        </p>
        <h2>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h2>
        <p>
          Frameworks are pre-designed collections of code (e.g. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This website, for instance, uses the Skeleton frameworks.
