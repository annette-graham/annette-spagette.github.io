        <h2>What is a responsive site? Why is responsiveness important?</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive sites are designed to adapt to the many differing screen sizes used to access the internet today. It is important that information on a website is as easy to access on a mobile or tablet as it is on a desktop.
        </p>
        <h2>What is mobile-first design? Why is it important</h2>
        <p>
          As websites are being accessed through many differing screen sizes, designers often build their websites to fit a mobile screen first. This is because it would be more difficult to adapt a webiste designed for a large screen to fit a small one than vice-versa.
        </p>
        <h2>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h2>
        <p>
          Frameworks are pre-designed collections of code (e.g. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This website, for instance, uses the Skeleton frameworks.
          <br/>
          Pros of using frameworks are that it makes web design quick and easy. Also, it's free!
          <br/>
          The cons are that there are limits to what the framework will allow you to do. Also, it doesn't enable you to practice designing them on your own.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a blueprint of the website and the layout of each page. It is used to help visualise the structure of a page.
        </p>
        <p>Here are my wireframes for this website:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="three columns">
          <img class="wireframe2" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-mobile">
            <p class="caption"><i>Mobile Index Page</i></p>
        </div>

        <div class="three columns">
          <img class="wireframe" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-desktop">
            <p class="caption"><i>Desktop Index Page</i></p>
        </div>

        <div class="three columns">
          <img class="wireframe" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe-blog-mobile">
            <p class="caption"><i>Mobile Blog Page</i></p>
        </div>

        <div class="three columns">
          <img class="wireframe" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe-blog-desktop">
            <p class="caption"><i>Desktop Blog Page</i></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class= "row">
        <h2>What aspects of your wireframe did you find difficult to implement and why?</h2>
        <p>
          I found images very difficult to implement. I'm still struggling to position them right and they aren't exactly where I would like them to be.
