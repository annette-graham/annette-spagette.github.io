        <h2>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h2>
        <p>
          I think it's a good course for people who are ready to fully immerse themselves in hard work. It isn't about perfection, but about giving each task your best shot. Be more "kitchen", less "restaurant".
        </p>
        <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        <p>
          It doesn't matter what experience or background you have upon starting. The work will be hard but rewarding.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        <p>
          I will ask questions and ask for help when needed. I will also help others when I am able. I enjoy teamwork, so am happy with group participation. I just need to remember to push on through the hard parts!
        </p>
        <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <p>
          Not massively, although I now know there will still be a heck of a lot of continuous learning after this course is finished. I'm not so concerned about my lack of prior knowledge now.
        </p>
        <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <p>
          I am very excited! Albeit nervous that I will be a slower learner than my peers.
