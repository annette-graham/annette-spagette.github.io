        <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
        <p>
          Grid based design is when a webpage is comprised of different columns and rows of varying sizes. It will often utilise people's tendency to read a page top to bottom, left to right. Almost every webpage will follow a grid based design, and of those, the majority will consist of 12 columns.
        </p>
        <h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive webpages allow for differing screen sizes. The content in the page will adapt to fit any screen. This is especially important in this day and age as it has become increasingly common to use the internet on phones and tablets, rather than just computer screens.
        </p>
        <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
        <p>
          Semantic structure is a way of organizing elements based on their meaning. For example, a header that uses the class "header". Furthermore, the most important header would use "h1", while the lesser ones would use "h2", "h3", etc. Semantic structures reduce ambiguity for those reading the tags.
