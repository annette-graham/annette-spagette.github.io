        <h2>When have you been blocked on a simple problem? When have you solved a problem in an elegant way?</h2>
        <p>
          I got blocked on a very simple problem for almost an hour and a half. I could not get my CSS to link to my HTML. I read through my links over and over and changed things that could have potentially been the cause, I left and came back ten minutes later with "fresh eyes", but nothing seemed to work! In the end, my dad sat with me and after about 20 minutes he noticed I was missing an equals sign after my href. I was so frustrated though the process. I was angry and upset and felt stupid. Once I realised my error I had to laugh! I learnt that I can't get wound up when I hit blocks and if it's nothing obvious, then it might be a syntax error!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I'm not sure any of my problem solving can be classed as 'elegant', but I find that writing out the problem at hand in English (pseudocode) can help. I feel like I can visualise the steps a lot more easily, and can figure out what JavaScript to use.
          <p/>
        </p>
        <h2>How do you feel using problem solving techniques and processes?</h2>
        <p>
          I like to use pdeudocode, as mentioned before. It maps things out in a language I understand (English). Googling is my go-to however. I have found that any problems I encounter, others have done so before! So reading how others have resolved the same problems is a massive help. I will ask my peers and coaches if all else fails! Reading error messages aren't always much help to me as they can be difficult to understand in themselves!
        </p>
        <h2>Explain the following:</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>.map( ):</i>
            <br/> This takes an existing array, and creates a new array with a secondary function. It will add the two arrays together to create and output a completely new one.
            </li>
            <li><i>.filter( ):</i>
              <br/> You start by defining the filter, and then apply it to an array so that only elements filling the given parameters are returned. E.g. words longer than five letters.
            </li>
            <li><i>.reduce( ):</i>
              <br/>This takes an element within an array and adds it to the accumulated value of the previous elements in order to reduce it to a single value.
            </li>
          </ul>
