        <h2>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h2>
        <p>
          I try to be as empathic as I can when conversing with others on matters than may require emapthy. It feels good to show an awareness of the feelings of another
        </p>
        <h2>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing</h2>
        <p>
          When I was flatting, one of my flatmates wasn't as clean as the rest of us. Very noticeably so. We were sick of having to clean up her mess, do her dishes, and redo the ones she had apparently washed. So one day we told her to sort her shit out because we were sick of the mess. In our view, this was a reasonable action to take.
          <br/><br/>
          In her eyes, she had the intention of cleaning up her stuff but was always busy. She felt she would have gotten around to it eventually. But she saw where we were coming from and made an effort to keep the place a bit tidier. Happy days!
