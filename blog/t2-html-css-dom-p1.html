        <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS, and DOM?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML is like the structure of a house. The foundations, frame, walls, roof, etc hold a house together, giving it structure in the same way HTML gives a website structure.
          </li><br/>
          <li>
            CSS can be thought of as the decorataions of the house. The colour of the paint, style of the curtains, where the furniture is placed. That sort of thing. CSS allows you to style the HTML in whichever way you like.
          </li><br/>
          <li>
            DOM can be compared to the blueprint of a house. It shows where things can be built and installed. DOM is a tree model, where the branches show the relationships of HTML tags.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
        <p>
          Boxifying design refers to the fact that all elements in a webpage are contained within boxes. These boxes are rectangular in shape and regardless of what shapes are displayed on a website, they will fit into a rectangular box of their own. This makes it easier for designers to visualise how different elements will fit together and how to manipulate them.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the Box Model?</h2>
        <p>
          The Box Model is a CSS term describing the invisible box that surrounds each element. The Box Model consists of the outer-most margins, the borders, the padding, and the inner-most content. These components can all be manipulated using CSS.
        </p>
        <h2>Wishlist:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Get a background image that I can make more transparent without causing the text to become transparent too.</li>
          <li>Create side columns.</li>
          <li>Have the elements of my website interact in more creative ways.</li>
          <li>Experiment with different colours and fonts.</li>
        </ol>
